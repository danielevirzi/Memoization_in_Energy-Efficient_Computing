sampling interval: 200, target function: lemmatization_cache, input size: In the vast expanse of the digital universe, information flows like an endless river, touching every 
        corner of the globe. The advent of the internet has revolutionized the way we communicate, learn, and conduct 
        business. With just a few clicks, we can access a wealth of knowledge that was unimaginable just a few 
        decades ago. However, this immense connectivity also brings challenges. The sheer volume of data generated 
        every second requires sophisticated algorithms and technologies to process and make sense of it. Artificial 
        intelligence and machine learning have become integral in managing this data deluge, enabling us to extract 
        insights and make informed decisions.Moreover, the rise of social media platforms has transformed how we 
        interact with one another.
